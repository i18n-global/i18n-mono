# v1.5.6 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 21, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Fix - Wrapper Empty String Filter

### Fixed Issue

The wrapper was previously wrapping empty strings and whitespace-only strings, which created meaningless translation keys.

### What Changed

**Before:**

```tsx
const value = ""; // Would be wrapped with t("")
const space = "   "; // Would be wrapped with t("   ")
```

**After:**

```tsx
const value = ""; // Skipped (empty string)
const space = "   "; // Skipped (whitespace only)
```

### Technical Details

- **FIX**: Wrapper now skips empty strings ("") and whitespace-only strings
- **IMPROVED**: Better filtering to avoid wrapping meaningless strings
- **IMPROVED**: Enhanced string validation logic

### Impact

- Cleaner translation files
- Fewer false positive translations
- Better developer experience
- Reduced manual cleanup needed
